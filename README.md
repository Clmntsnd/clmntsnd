<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Clement Senand 👋</h1>

I'm a dedicated and passionate student at [42 Quebec](https://42quebec.com/en/home/). I'm currently enrolled in the renowned 42 program, which focuses on project-based learning and developing practical coding skills.

I have a strong interest in software development and a desire to explore various domains of computer science. Through my journey at 42, I've gained hands-on experience in problem-solving, algorithm design, and collaborating with fellow students on exciting projects.
